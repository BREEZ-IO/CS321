# CS321 
What we're going to need to get done:

For the quiz:
-Edit plant database to have computer-readable information
-Come up with questions that can be answered on some sort of scale (ie. how much do you have to spend on a plant)
-From those questions, add certain values to each answer that will direct to each plant
-Implement answers->plant algorithm


For the reminders:
-Again, edit the plant database so we can get info from it
-Access time/date
-Do so whenever the page is opened
-Establish 'last time watered' variable that will remain after app/page is closed
-Establish 'how long till next water' variable from which plant is being watered
-Use above 2 variables to calculate if plant needs to be watered
-If possible: Have a way for the program to give reminders if it's not open? (might need some research here)
